What the project is?
Our project is a game (name to be decided later), where players will make narrative choice decisions that will impact other players. The narrative will be constructed (but not be limited to) individuals coming together as a group to resolve a conflict. All players may be presented with different choices for a given prompt, allowing players to experience stories differently and have unique motivations that affect the group dynamic.  Players are expected to have no direct communication while playing, as outside communication may affect their play experience.

How to setup any initial configuration?
