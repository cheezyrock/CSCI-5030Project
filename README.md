# What the project is?
Our project is a multiplayer narrative game, where players will make narrative choice decisions that will impact other players. The narrative will be constructed (but not be limited to) individuals coming together as a group to resolve a conflict. All players may be presented with different choices for a given prompt, allowing players to experience stories differently and have unique motivations that affect the group dynamic.  Players are expected to have no direct communication while playing, as outside communication may affect their play experience.

## How to download/install/use the projects?
Confirm python is on your computer. Download all associated files. Run the "Main.py" file to begin the game.

## How to setup any initial configuration?
A python environment will need to be setup in order to run the code.  The following packages need to be installed on the environment in order for it to function:

**Pillow** (pip install Pillow)<br>
**playsound** version 1.2.2 (pip install playsound==1.2.2)


A pre-made Conda environment with all necessary packages installed can be found in the NarrativeConda folder.  This may or may not work depending on how your python is set up and what tools you are using to manage your environments
